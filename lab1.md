The instruction for question 1 is to navigate to the `"/home"` directory using the `"pwd"` command. When using the `"cd"` command, if no directory is specified, it returns you to the previous folder. However, since we are already in the home directory, it remains in the current folder. The `"ls"` command is used to display a list of files and folders in the specified path. Meanwhile, the `"cat"` command is used to print the contents of one or more files specified by their paths. When no arguments are provided, nothing happens; you'll need to type some text. To exit, you can use `"ctrl+D."`

*2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.*

I entered the command `cd lecture1` which directed me to the folder specified by the path. After that, I entered the command `'cat message'` but it displayed a message indicating that `'message'` is a directory, not a file

When attempting to use the command `'cd Hello.class'` an error occurred because it is not a valid path. The `"cd"` command is used to change directories, and it requires a valid directory path, not a file name. Similarly, the `"ls Hello.class"` command simply lists the files and directories in the current directory. Lastly, when using the `"cat Hello.class"` command, it displayed the content of the `"Hello.class"` file.
