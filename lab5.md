# Lab 5

## Part 1



## Part 2
I really enjoyed the process of the class, through constant practice and learning. Every week, I am wholeheartedly and actively participating in the labs to really get to grips with the new knowledge. I found vim and bash very interesting to learn. Especially `vim` let me know the newest way to operate. And `bash` taught me how commands become. Maybe I can understand it like this.
