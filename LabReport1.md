1.Share an example of using the command with no arguments.
The direction for question 1 is "/home", I used the "pwd". The ouput for "cd" is change the direction, if I put nothing, then it go back to perious folder. But since this is the home file. It will still at the current folder. For "ls", it is to show the list of the filds and folder in the give path. For "cat" is used to print the cotects of one or more files given by the paths. But I put blank argument. So nothing happens, let me to type some words. Which I used "ctrl+D" to exit.

2. Share an exmaple of using the command with a path to a directory as an argument.
I typed "cd lecture1" which direct to the folder as the path. Then I typed the message, it is showed about the messages folder inside. For "cat message", it showed this is a direction, not a file.

Share an example of using the command with a path to a file as an argument.
For "cd Hello.class", since it is not a path. So the showed error. For ls, it just showed the list of the files. And for "cat Hello.class", it showed the content of the Hello.class.
