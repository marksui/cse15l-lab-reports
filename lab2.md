## Part3
During the second and third week, I learned many skills about terminals and how to connect to the school computer. I believe that these skills helped me a lot, allowing me to run programs without having to configure a local computer just by connecting to the school's computer. In my previous school, I used to connect to the school's servers through ssh and passwords, and since my passwords were complicated, I hated entering them. In this week, I learned that by using secret key, we don't need to enter the password. This is very convenient and time saving. In addition, I have gained a deeper knowledge of the internet and web pages, in terms of constructing web pages and analyzing links.
